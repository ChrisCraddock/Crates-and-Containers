# Crates-and-Containers

![Containers1](/Texture%20Ideas/Display/Containers1.png)

This small decorations pack was created for those who want more storage in a smaller place or themed storage to decorate warehouses, shipping yards, industrial buildings, or snow themed biomes.

### Minecraft Java ver: 1.16.5
### Forge ver: 36.2.0

## Contents:
* 15 3x1 shipping containers with no snow
* 16 3x1 shipping containers with snow
* 13 1x1 wood crates with no snow
* 11 1x1 wood crates with snow

### Container storage
* 180 slots divided between 3 container blocks

### Crate storage
* 33 slots per crate

## Lifecycle
This pack was designed for 1.16.5.  While I cannot *promise* that I will be regularly updating the pack for future or past versions,
EVERYTHING is uploaded on my [GitHub](https://github.com/ChrisCraddock/Crates-and-Containers) page if you want to try and make it for
a different version.  As I get better with converting things to other versions of Minecraft, I may revisit this and post it. 

## Getting Started

### Containers
1. Craft the bench by using any of the vanilla wood (not planks) with an Iron block in the center of the grid.
2. The Basic containers are the only ones able to be crafted.  The bench will then present you with color options for each of the portion of the container you insert.
  2a. Only the snow containers can be used to create containers with snow, and only basic containers can be used to create containers without snow.
  2b. To convert a Basic container to a basic Snow container, put the Basic container in the center of a crafting grind with 3 snow balls across the top.  The process is not reversable.
3. The 3 different parts of the Containers are with metal bars on top, oak wood chests in the middle, and iron blocks on the bottom. For those on MCreator, view the attached zip file for a visual on crafting each if needed.  For those on CurseForge, view the attached screenshots.

### Crates
1. Craft the bench by using any of the vanilla wood (not planks) with a Cobblestone block in the center of the grid.
2. The Basic crate is the only one able to be crafted.  The bench will then present you with color options for the crates.
  2a. Only the snow crates can be used to create crates with snow, and only basic crates can be used to create crates without snow.
  2b. To convert a Basic crate to a basic Snow crate, put the Basic crate in the center of a crafting grind with 3 snow balls across the top.  The process is not reversable.
3. Craft the basic crate by using 8 vanilla wood planks with a Cobblestone block in the center of the grid. For those on MCreator, view the attached zip file for a visual on crafting each if needed.  For those on CurseForge, view the attached screenshots.

### Known Issue:
While it is not really an "issue", I am still working to figure out the logic of how to have the crates and containers keep their inventory when broken. 
This would make moving bases much more easier.  If you do know the specific procedue to do this (have the procedure completed and I would just need to modify 1 or 2 things),
let me know and I will add it and credit you for the procedure on all sites.
